## **Responsiveness**


#### Test 
I have tested responsiveness during development with developer inspector tools. Then I have tested with help of the apps called [Responsively]() and [Am I responsive]().\
Test was also done on the actual devices: Lenovo Laptop 17.3" / Alpha a1 20+ / Xiaomi Redmi 9t /  iPhone 7 / iPhone 8 / iPhone 10 / iPad 

#### Result 
The page looks good on all tested devices and its fully responsive. The Navigation menu collapses on tablet and mobile sizes and expands on desktop size. Hero image is not destorted and displays nicely on all screen sizes tested.

#### Conclusion
Test result is satisfactory, everything is functioning as intended.
