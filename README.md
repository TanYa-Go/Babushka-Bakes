## **Babushka Bakes**

Babushka Bakes is a lovely small bakery run by the pastry chef Petra Dragojlovic. The two big passions of hers are making cakes for any occasion and making different kinds of bread. She can make all your other pastry wishes come through but these are her two true loves.
She wanted a website that will showcase her work, keep in contact with her customers, and where she will also be able to receive orders. I created a site where she can communicate any news about her products and share some of her famous recipes through the blog. Then there is a shop where customers can order some of the staples from her kitchen, and through the contact form people can contact her for any questions or orders they wish to place.

## **The Strategy Plane**


### **User Goals**

 Users can be divided in two categories:

* #### **Site Visitor / Shopper**

   Site visior/shopper's goal is to be able to easily browse the website on any device so that they can quickly find what they  are   looking for. Whether that is to buy products or just find some inspiration for their own baking. The easier is to find the contact information to contact the site owner, the better experience they will have. They need to clearly see what is the benefit of signing up for the account and what benefits will that bring them. 

* #### **Staff**

  Staff goal is to maintain the website as per site owners wishes. They need to have an easy access to the admin panel and the login details so they can update the content required. The site needs to be intuitive for them and clearly show options for adding and updating certain details.

## **The Surface Plane**

### **Design Choices**

<a></a>

#### **Colors**

I wanted the website to have a warm feel to it and to invoke feelings of happines and remind us of something sweet and soft, as desserts usually make us feel. I decided to use use the pink and bluish/green color for the website, with some dark grey and white to contrast it.

#### **Typography**

Apart from looking like a happy place, I wanted the website to also have an elegant feel to it so I have chosen the Mohave font for the majority of the webiste.
