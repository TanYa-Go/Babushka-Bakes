They’re kind of crunchy and cracked on the outside, making those nooks just purrrrrfect for soaking up the thick, shiny, crackled glaze. We completely dunk the doughnuts in that glaze in the recipe, and it’s amazing. The inside is soft and cakey with a more firm bite than yeast doughnuts. Plus you can’t beat sour cream, it’s good with just about everything.\r\n\r\nI don’t always prefer old-fashioned cake doughnuts to yeast doughnuts, but when I do this is absolutely the recipe I use. You can’t beat how much less time these take than yeast doughnuts, too.\r\n\r\nINGREDIENTS\r\n\r\n * For the donuts:\r\n\r\n2 1/4 cup (255 grams) cake flour\r\n1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder\r\n1 teaspoon salt\r\n1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg\r\n1/2 cup (100 grams) sugar\r\n2 tablespoons (29 grams) butter, at COOL room temperature\r\n2 large egg yolks\r\n1/2 cup (113 grams) sour cream\r\nCanola oil, for frying\r\n\r\n* For the glaze:\r\n\r\n3 1/2 cup (350 grams) powdered sugar, sifted\r\n1 1/2 teaspoons corn syrup\r\n1/4 teaspoon salt\r\n1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\r\n1/3 cup hot water\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS\r\n\r\n * For the donuts:\r\n\r\nIn a bowl, sift together the cake flour, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.\r\n\r\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together until sandy. Add the egg yolks and mix until light and thick. Add the dry ingredients to the mixing bowl in 3 additions, alternating with the sour cream, ending with the flour.\r\n\r\nMix for 30 seconds on low speed or until the dough is smooth but slightly sticky. You want to mix enough that the dough doesn't fall apart in the oil, but not so much that it becomes tough. If the dough is unbearably sticky, add extra flour one tablespoon at a time (especially if you live in a warm & humid climate).\r\n\r\nCover with plastic wrap and chill for 1 hour, or until firm.\r\n\r\nOn a floured surface, roll out the dough to about 1/2 inch thickness. Use a doughnut cutter or two differently sized biscuit cutters to cut out as many donuts as possible, dipping the cutters into flour as necessary to prevent sticking. You should get about 12 doughnuts and holes. If the dough gets too loose, sticky, or greasy at any point return to the fridge to firm before continuing. Refrigerate while you heat the oil so the dough is slightly cold when it fries.\r\n\r\n\r\nPour 2 inches of canola oil into a heavy bottomed pot with a deep-fry thermometer attached. Heat to 325°F. Fry the doughnuts a few at a time, being careful not to overcrowd the pot. Fry on each side about 2 minutes, being careful not to let them burn. Keep an eye on the thermometer and adjust your stove heat to maintain the correct oil temperature. Let drain on a paper bag to soak up the excess grease.\r\n\r\n* For the glaze:\r\n\r\nMix all ingredients in a bowl with a whisk until smooth. Immerse each doughnut into the glaze. Place on a wire rack above a sheet pan to catch any excess glaze. Let sit for 20 minutes until glaze is set. Doughnuts are best served the day they are made but may be store in an air tight container at room temperature for a few days.", "image": "blog-donuts.png"}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 6, "fields": {"title": "Make the Best Sourdough Bread", "subtitle": "Sourdough bread is something you learn by doing.

You’re not going to make a great loaf by reading a recipe or hunkering down with a cookbook; you’re going to have to get your hands in the dough, and you might have to try it a few times. Even after making sourdoughs for years, I still get bloopers, like the first loaf I made from Tartine No. 3. Stay with the process, learn to work with the ingredients, and enjoy the adventure.\r\n\r\nWHAT MAKES SOURDOUGH BREAD SOUR\r\n\r\nSourdough bread is made entirely using wild yeast — with a strong, active sourdough culture of wild yeast, you won’t need any commercial yeast at all. Wild yeast need a little more coaxing and works a little more slowly than commercial yeast, so sourdough breads are normally  mixed, shaped, and baked over the course of a day, or even multiple days. Besides giving the wild yeast time to do its job, this long, slow development time helps tease out more complex, nuanced flavors in the finished bread — far beyond those of your average loaf of sandwich bread.\r\n\r\nWhile the wild yeast is certainly the star of this show, it’s not actually what makes the bread sour. That distinctive sour flavor comes from two kinds of friendly bacteria — Lactobacillus and acetobacillus — which grow alongside the wild yeast in the sourdough culture and  help ferment the sugars in the dough.\r\n\r\nAlso, note that sourdough breads don’t always necessarily taste sour. Depending on how you develop your starter and make your bread,  the sour flavor can be quite pronounced or it can be more subtle. The recipe here strikes a balance — it’s a touch sour, but it’s balanced by a nice range of sweet, earthy, and yeasty flavors.\r\n\r\nTHE SOURDOUGH STARTER\r\n\r\nBefore you can make a loaf of sourdough bread, you need to make a sourdough starter. This is a culture of flour and water for growing wild yeast and developing those bacterias. Having a “ripe,” or fully developed, starter ensures a good rise and good flavor development in your sourdough bread.\r\n\r\nYou can make your own starter in about five days. On the first day, you mix flour and water into a batter, and let them sit at room temperature  overnight. Wild yeast are everywhere — on the flour, in the air, on your hands — and they will quickly start to thrive in this culture. Over the next few days, you’ll need to feed the yeast and bacteria by pouring off some of the culture and adding fresh flour and water. You’ll know it’s ready to use to make bread when the culture becomes very bubbly within just a few hours of feeding, and when it smells sour but fresh.", "image": "breads.jpg"}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 25, "fields": {"title": "Marshmallow Buttercream Frosting", "subtitle": "Perfect for cakes, cupcakes, layer cakes—or sometimes sneaking a spoonful.", "author": 1, "body": "This extraordinarily silky version of buttercream gets its texture and soft sweetness from marshmallow creme and is one of my favorite scratch frostings.
